# Cosmetics-

In this project, I processed ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding, 
then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called [t-SNE9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.
