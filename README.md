# Cosmetics Analysis

In this project, I processed ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), 
then visualized ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) and an interactive visualization library called [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/). 

## Introduction

<p>These days, because I wear a mask every day, skin problems are frequently occurring. For this, I want to try new cosmetics, but sometimes new attempts can worsen skin troubles. There's ingredient information behind cosmetics, but it's difficult to understand and what to avoid.</p>

<p>To help with this, I created a content-based recommendation system in which content becomes a chemical component of cosmetics.</p>
