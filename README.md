# Cosmetics-

In this project, I processed ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), 
then visualized ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) and an interactive visualization library called [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/).
